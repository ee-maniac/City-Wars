## Overview
City Wars is a turn based card game developed as part of the object oriented programming (OOP) course at Sharif University of Technology (SUT) in mid 2024. The game showcases fundamental object oriented programming concepts through both command line and interactive graphical interface.

## Getting Started

### Execution
Both versions of the game require the provided SQLite libraries with graphic version requiring JavaFX library (version 21.0.3 or later) as well. The working directory for the graphic version should not contain "src" in its url.

### Interface
A list of all available commands and interactions are provided in two .txt files located in their respected directories.

### Gameplay
The gameplay mechanics are largely based on the City Wars: Tokyo Reign game.
